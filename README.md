# typing-test-swing
A simple Java app to measure a user's speed of typing (Russian localization included)

I really made this as a qualification test for a kind of job, but I think the code may be of interest to community.
This application is a cross of a personal testing/training software and a game.

The source contains code in Java which is built on Swing framework enhanced with com.intellij forms for ease of development using IntelliJ Idea.
doc directory contains a document describing the program's functions, structure and a process of developing one.

yours,
